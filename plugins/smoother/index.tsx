 * again. Blocked and ignored messages all fold into one row, so a page of them adds next to
 * nothing - measured: 28 more blocked messages made the list 52 px taller. Discord also keeps
 * only 60 messages loaded, so the row reads "60 blocked messages" however far back it goes.
 * Every scroll quietly pages a little further and nothing on screen changes: it looks stuck.
 *
 * A scroll now carries on by itself, a page at a time, while each page is still all hidden.
 * The moment a page has something to show, Discord takes over as it always does.
